# Matrices
/* 
In order to use different data types, the project is using templates. Moreover, it is specified to arithmetic types only. 
Using this project, a matrix can be created by: 
a- using the square matrix property (the size, and what is the value)
b- initializing the numbers of rows and columns (the default value of the elements is 0)
c- adding an already initialized Matrix as an argument. 
d- importing a matrix from a file. 
It is possible to set a value to a specific element in the matrix.
Moreover, the project preforms all matrix operations, by overriding operators, such as: 
a-	Matrix addition
b-	Matrix subtraction
c-	Matrix multiplication by:
 -a number 
-another matrix 
-a vector
The determinate and dot product, as well, can be calculated.
Vectors is another templated class that was created. 
Vectors can by created by:
- Sitting the size, the values can be either initialized to 0s (by default) or using the random function which will set random values. 
-	Selecting a specific column or a row of a matrix. 
Moreover, the scalar product can be calculated.
